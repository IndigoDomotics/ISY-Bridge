#ISY Bridge

This plugin will allow Indigo to control devices through an ISY controller. You can also execute scenes and programs. The original author of the plugin gave us permission to open source the code for this plugin.

Several fixes were made to the plugin to make it compatible (and, in fact, it requires) Indigo 6. Also, there were some changes to the ISY REST API which have been incorporated. This plugin has been tested with the following ISY Controllers and firmware:

| ISY Controller | Firmware Version(s) |
|:--------------:|:-------------------:|
| ISY-944i | v4.0.5 |
