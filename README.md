ISY Bridge
==========

This plugin will allow Indigo to control devices through an ISY controller. You
can also execute scenes and programs. The original author of the plugin gave us
permission to open source the code for this plugin.

Several fixes were made to the plugin to make it compatible (and, in fact, it
**requires**) Indigo 6. Also, there were some changes to the ISY REST API which
have been incorporated. This plugin has been tested with the following ISY
Controllers and firmware:

| ISY Controller | Firmware Version(s) |
|----------------|---------------------|
| ISY-944i       | v4.0.5              |
| ISY-994i Zwave | v5.0.11             |

Downloading for use
-------------------

If you are a user and just want to download and install the plugin, click on the
**Download ZIP** button to the right and it will download the plugin and readme
file to a folder in your Downloads directory called **ISY-Bridge**. Once it's
downloaded just open that folder and double-click on the **ISY
Bridge.indigoPlugin** file to have the client install and enable it for you.

How to use
----------

Once you've installed the plugin, you'll need to create an ISY Controller
device. Create a new device, select **ISY Bridge** from the **Type:** popup,
then select **ISY Controller** from the **Model:** popup. You'll get a config
dialog where you can select your ISY from a popup list and add authentication
details. When you save the config dialog, the plugin will automatically talk to
the ISY to get a list of all supported devices and it will automatically create
Indigo devices representing each one. It will make them in the same folder where
you created the ISY Controller device.

(Important note: don't be confused or fooled by the other types of devices you
can add--those are artifacts of the API.  The devices on the ISY side will
be automatically added to the Indigo side; you just need to add the controller.)

If you later add a device, you can select the **Plugins-\>ISY Bridge-\>Update
ISY** menu item and you'll be able to hit a button to update devices (it will
add any that aren't present). It will also rebuild the list of scenes and
programs.

The plugin presents 2 events: when a program finishes the THEN portion of a
program or when a program finishes the ELSE portion of a program. ISY users will
understand this.

The plugin also presents 3 actions: **Send Scene On Command**, **Send Scene Off
Command**, **Send Program Command**. These are pretty self-explanatory.

Currently supported device types are: *Dimmers*, *On/Off (relay) devices*,
*Sprinklers*, *Thermostats*, and the *I/O Linc*. We've added an enhancement
issue to expand that list but it'll have to be done by someone else.

Release Notes for V2.0
----------------------

I have made extensive changes to the UDI plugin to support Z-Wave devices and
X-10 devices (which appear as semi-Insteon devices on the UDI).  My goal in most
of these changes is to make a UDI be a "slave" of the Indigo, so the major changes
are all in device support.  I have also updated so that this works with v5 of the
UDI firmware.  

My main goals were to get bi-directonal communications very stable (so that turning
a device on/off/dim/bright on either side is properly communicated) and to get
Z-Wave up and running.  (If Indigo supported two Z-Wave sticks, I wouldn't have 
had to do this at all...) 

The UDI exposes a lot of very specific data about each device, which means that
if I don't have a device in my lab, then it's likely that it won't be properly
supported as it moves over to Indigo-land.  If you find specific issues and want
help fixing them, I am happy to lend a hand.  

There are a ton of new debugging messages enabled; I suggest you do not turn
on debugging unless you really are debugging, as you'll see many things that
are either confusing or distracting.

A few messages are still showing up in the Indigo logs, specifically "list index 
out of range: <a.b.c.d>" (where a.b.c.d is the IP of your UDI).  This is generally
harmless; it indicates that the plugin is trying to reach over to the Indigo and
touch a device which the Indigo doesn't have configured.  This is usually a sign
of a bug in the plugin, but when they are popping up only once a day, I am not
trying too hard to get rid of them.  And they don't indicate any harmful activity.

If you are seeing a lot of red messages in your Indigo logs, you have definitely
found a bug.  

Some limitations on the Z-Wave support: I focused on ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHT types of
operations, so things like energy reporting are not making it over to Indigo. That's
on my to-do list when I revisit this in the Spring.  Also, some more complex 
Z-Wave devices, such as the Aeon Micro-Dimmers, have a lot of features related
to Z-Wave scenes that are not being exported over to Indigo-land.
